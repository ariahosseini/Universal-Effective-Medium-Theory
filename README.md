The ability to tune phonon transport through nanoscale engineering holds promises for thermal management and energy conversion applications. At the nanoscale, phonon-mediated thermal transport significantly deviates from the bulk diffusive scheme. Therefore, predicting thermal conductivity in the non-diffusive regime requires models, such as the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), that capture phonons' size effects. Although the BTE is robust and has been well validated against several key experiments, its applicability is computationally expensive. Thus, several analytical models have been put forward to estimate the effective thermal conductivity in low length scales. These methods are mostly based on simplified material descriptions such as gray-medium approximation; Assuming mean-free-path (MFP) independent population of phonons leads to an inaccurate description of phonons' behavior in nanostructured materials. To fill this gap, we developed the reduced-order closed-form ''Ballistic Correction Model'' (BCM) that takes into account the whole spectrum of MFP distribution and describes the reduction in thermal conductivity due to the size effects with effective Knudsen number. We used the BCM model to compute the thermal conductivity of thin films, nanowires, and bulk materials with nanoscale porosity. We validate our approach, against BTE-informed simulations, obtaining excellent agreement. Providing a simple yet accurate estimation of thermal transport in thin films, our work sets out to accelerate the discovery of materials for energy-conversion and thermal-management applications.

# Theory

To begin, we lay out the theoretical basis for the Ballistic Correction Model (BCM). The starting point of the BCM model is to approximate the normalized cumulative thermal conductivity as

These logistic function approximations (on a log scale abscissa) hold for most of materials and simple geometries.
